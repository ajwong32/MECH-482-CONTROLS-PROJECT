Problem Description: An agricultural producer needs an automated belt speed controller for one of their conveyor lines. This will provide a consistent output rate without the need for constant obvservation and adjustment. 

Solution: A Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) loop will be used to meet a desired output of plants from a conveyor belt system. The output of plants on the operating line will be determined by varying the speed of the conveyor belt. The project will involve creating a mathematical model representing the PID loop. The loop will adjust the conveyor belt speeds to output the desired number of plants per hour. 


### MatLAB Code

The following code comprises the closed feedback loop needed to operate the converyor belt.

# Initial Parameters for Simulation

numG=1; % Numerator of transfer function
denG=[0.5 1 0]; % Characteristic equation of transfer function
sys=tf(numG,denG); % Create transfer function
t=0:0.01:5; % Define range of time for simulation
figure(1);
[y1,t]=step(sys,t); % Step response of the system
